## Description
The CodeMastery Program is a comprehensive and robust software development program designed to equip developers with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry. The program focuses on a wide range of technologies and methodologies, providing a solid foundation for any software engineer.

## Tech Stack
The CodeMastery Program utilizes a diverse tech stack to ensure a well-rounded understanding of modern software development. The tech stack includes:

- **Java22**: The latest version of Java, providing a high level of efficiency and speed in development.
- **Spring Boot**: An open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- **EPAM DIAL as LLM**: A robust and flexible language lifecycle management tool.
- **Valina JS and W3.js**: Lightweight JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program, classified as a NoSQL database program.
- **Spring AI**: Integration with Azure OpenAI and Qdrant for AI capabilities.
- **Azure OpenAI**: Advanced language models for natural language processing tasks.
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for efficient similarity search and RAG implementation.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- We implement RAG to enhance the capabilities of our AI system:
- Document Ingestion: Automatically process and index relevant documentation and code snippets.
- Vector Embedding: Convert text into high-dimensional vectors for efficient similarity search.
- Similarity Search: Utilize Qdrant to quickly find the most relevant information based on user queries.
- Context-Aware Responses: Combine retrieved information with the power of language models to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
